# HIPAA Compliance Skill for Claude

A comprehensive Claude skill that provides expert HIPAA compliance guidance across four domains: document review, policy generation, technical safeguards, and plain-language education.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This skill provides informational guidance only and does not constitute legal advice. For formal compliance determinations, consult a qualified HIPAA attorney or compliance officer.

---

## What Does This Skill Do?

The HIPAA Compliance Skill transforms Claude into a knowledgeable HIPAA advisor capable of handling the full range of compliance questions that arise in healthcare and health-adjacent organizations.

At a high level, the skill does four things:

1. **Reviews content and documents for HIPAA compliance issues** — It analyzes policies, system architectures, workflows, and vendor agreements, producing structured findings with rule citations, risk levels (High / Medium / Low), and prioritized remediation steps.

2. **Generates HIPAA-compliant policies, notices, and templates** — It produces ready-to-use documents including Notices of Privacy Practices (NPP), Business Associate Agreements (BAA), authorization forms, breach response plans, risk assessment templates, and workforce training acknowledgments — all with inline CFR citations.

3. **Advises on technical safeguards for software systems** — It guides developers and architects through HIPAA's Administrative, Physical, and Technical Safeguard requirements, with specific guidance for modern cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP), API security, encryption standards, audit logging, and DevOps practices.

4. **Explains HIPAA rules in plain language** — It translates dense regulatory text into accessible explanations for any audience, always leading with a plain-language summary before diving into regulatory detail.

The skill is backed by four detailed reference files covering the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, Breach Notification Rule, and a full library of document templates — loaded selectively based on what the question actually requires.

## How to Use the Skill

### Installation
Download `hipaa-compliance.skill` and install it in Claude's skill settings. Once installed, the skill activates automatically when your conversation involves HIPAA-related topics.

### Triggering the Skill
The skill is designed to trigger on a wide range of healthcare and compliance-related language. You don't need special syntax — just describe what you need naturally. Trigger phrases include:

- Direct mentions: *HIPAA, PHI, ePHI, covered entity, business associate, BAA*
- Document requests: *"draft a privacy notice," "generate a BAA," "create a risk assessment"*
- Compliance questions: *"is this HIPAA compliant?", "what does HIPAA require for...?"*
- System reviews: *"review our architecture," "audit our data handling"*
- Breach scenarios: *"we had a data incident," "employee accessed the wrong records"*

### Example Prompts

```
# Document review
"Here is our current data sharing agreement with our billing vendor.
Please review it for HIPAA compliance and flag any missing provisions."

# Template generation
"Generate a Notice of Privacy Practices for Valley Medical Group,
a multi-specialty outpatient clinic in California. Effective date: January 1, 2025."

# Technical guidance
"We're building a telehealth platform on AWS. What HIPAA technical safeguards
do we need to implement? We're using EC2, RDS (PostgreSQL), S3, and SES."

# Breach assessment
"An employee sent a spreadsheet containing names, DOBs, and diagnoses for
47 patients to the wrong email address. The recipient responded saying
they didn't open it. Walk me through whether we have a reportable breach."

# Education
"Explain the minimum necessary standard and give me three concrete
examples of how it applies in a hospital setting."
```

### Output Format
Depending on the request type, outputs follow structured formats:

- **Compliance Reviews** → Findings table (Issue / CFR Reference / Risk Level / Recommendation) + prioritized action items
- **Templates** → Complete documents with `[PLACEHOLDER]` fields and inline CFR citations
- **Technical Assessments** → Safeguard checklist organized by Administrative / Physical / Technical
- **Education** → Plain-language summary followed by regulatory detail and examples

### Inputs Used to Build This Skill

The skill was built based on the following requirements provided during design:

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Core capabilities** | Compliance review, policy/template generation, technical safeguards advice, plain-language education |
| **Target audiences** | Developers, compliance officers, legal teams, general business staff (all of the above) |
| **Reference depth** | Detailed — full coverage of Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule |
| **Regulatory basis** | 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 (HIPAA), as amended by HITECH (2009) |

| **Skill format** | Claude Skill (`.skill` file) with `SKILL.md` + 4 bundled reference files |

### Design Decisions

**Audience-aware tone:** The skill is explicitly instructed to adjust depth and language based on who is asking — developers get technical specifics and code-level guidance, compliance officers get CFR citations, and general staff get plain-language explanations.

**Risk stratification:** All compliance findings are categorized as High / Medium / Low risk to help users prioritize remediation effort.

**Legal disclaimer:** Every compliance output includes a disclaimer that this is informational guidance, not legal advice, to ensure users understand the appropriate role of this tool.

**State law flag:** The skill is designed to note when state law may impose stricter requirements than HIPAA (particularly for mental health, HIV/AIDS, and reproductive health information).

**Encryption guidance:** The skill correctly represents encryption as "addressable" under HIPAA while communicating that AES-256 / TLS 1.2+ is the industry standard — an important nuance that generic compliance tools often get wrong.
