## What This Skill Does

The ISO 42001 skill transforms Claude into a knowledgeable ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Lead Auditor and AIMS implementation consultant. It covers the world's first international standard for AI Management Systems in full — from gap assessment through certification readiness, with deep coverage of AI risk assessment, AI System Impact Assessment (AISIA), all 38 Annex A controls, and AI governance policy generation.

**Designed for:**
- AI providers (organisations that develop, train, or deploy AI systems)
- AI users (organisations that integrate third-party AI into their operations)
- GRC, compliance, and legal teams managing AI governance obligations
- Software and data science teams needing to understand what controls apply to their AI systems
- Organisations aligning to the EU AI Act who need an AIMS foundation
- Certification bodies and auditors needing reference material

## Capabilities

### Gap Analysis
Structured assessment across all mandatory clauses (4–10) and all 38 Annex A controls. Outputs a prioritised gap register with 🔴/🟡/🟢 status, evidence requirements, and a phased remediation roadmap.

### AI System Impact Assessment (AISIA)
Guides the mandatory AISIA process step by step — documenting AI systems, identifying affected populations, assessing impact dimensions (severity, reversibility, breadth, consent, human oversight), classifying impact level (Low/Medium/High), and determining proportionate control requirements.

### AI Risk Assessment
Covers all AI risk categories — model risks (bias, drift, hallucination, adversarial), data risks (quality, poisoning, privacy), operational risks (scope creep, human over-reliance), and supply chain risks (third-party models, API dependencies). Outputs a risk register with likelihood × severity scoring and risk treatment decisions.

### Statement of Applicability (SoA)
Generates a complete SoA table covering all 38 Annex A controls with applicability decisions, justifications, and implementation status — ready for auditor review.

### Policy Generation
Drafts all core AIMS policies with document control blocks, ISO 42001 clause and control citations, and responsible AI principles integrated:
- AI Policy (Clause 5.2)
- AI Risk Management Policy
- AI Acceptable Use Policy
- Data Governance for AI Policy
- AI Incident Management Policy
- AI System Lifecycle Policy
- AI Supplier Management Policy

### Certification Readiness
Produces Stage 1 (documentation review) and Stage 2 (implementation verification) audit checklists with RAG status, evidence requirements per clause, and common auditor focus areas.

### Framework Integration
Maps ISO 42001 to:
- **ISO 27001:2022** — integrated ISMS + AIMS
- **NIST AI RMF** — Map/Measure/Manage/Govern to 42001 clauses
- **EU AI Act** — AISIA to Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA); high-risk AI system controls
- **ISO 31000** — AI risk assessment methodology alignment

## Example Prompts

After installing the skill, try these:

**Gap assessment:**
> "We're a SaaS company that uses GPT-4 via API for our customer support chatbot and a custom ML model for churn prediction. Run an ISO 42001 gap assessment. We have no AIMS documentation yet."

**AISIA:**
> "Help me complete an AI System Impact Assessment for our automated employee performance review system. It uses ML to recommend ratings. It affects 2,000 employees."

**AI risk assessment:**
> "What are the key AI risks we should assess for a large language model we're deploying for internal legal document drafting?"

**Policy generation:**
> "Draft an AI Acceptable Use Policy for a mid-size financial services firm. We use third-party AI tools including Microsoft Copilot and a custom credit risk model."

**SoA:**
> "Generate a Statement of Applicability for all 38 ISO 42001 Annex A controls. We're an AI provider. Mark A.10 decommission controls as not yet applicable — our AI systems are all in early deployment."

**Certification readiness:**
> "We're targeting ISO 42001 Stage 2 audit in 3 months. What evidence do we need and what are auditors most likely to test?"

**EU AI Act alignment:**
