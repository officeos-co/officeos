//! Sandbox trait for pluggable OS-level isolation.
//!
//! This module defines the [`Sandbox`] trait, which abstracts OS-level process
//! isolation backends. Implementations wrap shell commands with platform-specific
//! sandboxing (e.g., seccomp, AppArmor, namespaces) to limit the blast radius
//! of tool execution. The agent runtime selects and applies a sandbox backend
//! before executing any shell command.

use async_trait::async_trait;
use std::process::Command;

/// Sandbox backend for OS-level process isolation.
///
/// Implement this trait to add a new sandboxing strategy. The runtime queries
/// [`is_available`](Sandbox::is_available) at startup to select the best
/// backend for the current platform, then calls
/// [`wrap_command`](Sandbox::wrap_command) before every shell execution.
///
/// Implementations must be `Send + Sync` because the sandbox may be shared
/// across concurrent tool executions on the Tokio runtime.
