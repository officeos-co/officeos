![Auto Browser demo](docs/assets/demo.gif)

> **Give your AI agent a real browser, with a human in the loop.**

Auto Browser is an MCP-native browser control plane for authorized workflows. It gives MCP clients, LLM agents, and operators a shared Playwright browser with human takeover, reusable auth profiles, approvals, audit trails, and local-first deployment.

Works with:

- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- any MCP client that can talk HTTP or stdio
- direct REST callers when you want curl-first control

## Why Auto Browser

- **MCP-native from day one.** The browser surface is already packaged as an MCP server instead of bolted on after the fact.
- **Human takeover when the web gets brittle.** noVNC keeps the same live session available when a person needs to step in.
- **Login once, reuse later.** Save named auth profiles and reopen fresh sessions that are already signed in.
- **Local-first by default.** Run the full stack on your own box with Docker Compose, or use Codespaces for a quick hosted demo.
- **Safety rails built in.** Approvals, operator identity, PII scrubbing, Witness receipts, and compliance templates are all part of the product surface.

## Release Highlights (v1.0.2)

- **Framework security updates** with FastAPI and Starlette pinned to the current patched line
- **Safer error boundaries** across browser actions, CDP, OCR, mesh, workflow, tunnel, social, and share-token surfaces
- **Rate-limit hardening** with bounded buckets and hashed operator identifiers
- **Host and path policy tightening** for production `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, auth profile paths, and upload roots
- **1.0 platform surface** including signed mesh delegation, workflow routes, `/dashboard`, noVNC takeover, MCP transport, audit trails, and readiness checks

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history.

## Good Fits

- internal dashboards and admin tools
- operator-assisted QA and browser debugging
- login-once, reuse-later account workflows
- brittle sites where a human may need to recover the flow
- MCP-powered agent workflows that need a real browser, not just HTML fetches

## Not the Goal

- stealth or anti-bot work
- CAPTCHA solving
- unauthorized scraping or account automation
- deceptive identity shaping or bypass tooling

## What You Get

| Browser Control                                                                                                           | Operator Safety                                                                                                   | Deployment and Integration                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Playwright-backed sessions with screenshots, DOM summaries, OCR excerpts, tab controls, downloads, and network inspection | approval gates, operator identity headers, audit events, PII scrubbing, Witness receipts, and protection profiles | MCP over HTTP, bundled stdio bridge, REST API, Docker Compose, Codespaces, auth profiles, and optional per-session isolation |

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LvcidPsyche/auto-browser.git
cd auto-browser
docker compose up --build
```

That is enough for local development with the default settings.

Optional:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make doctor
```

Run `make doctor` from a normal terminal with local Docker access and permission to open localhost sockets.

Open:

- API docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Operator dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard`
- Visual takeover: `http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=scale`

All published ports bind to `127.0.0.1` by default.

## Try It in Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/LvcidPsyche/auto-browser?quickstart=1)

Codespaces provisions the stack automatically. The dashboard and noVNC tabs are usually ready in about 90 seconds.

## First Useful Demo

The highest-signal flow in this repo is:

1. create a session
2. log in manually if the site needs a human
3. save the session as a named auth profile
4. open a new session from that auth profile
5. continue work without reauthing

Start here:

- [`examples/login-and-save-profile.md`](./examples/login-and-save-profile.md)
- [`examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md)

Minimal session creation:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/sessions \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"demo","start_url":"https://example.com"}' | jq
```

Minimal observation:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/sessions/<session-id>/observe | jq
```

## MCP Clients

Auto Browser exposes:

- an HTTP MCP endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`
- convenience endpoints at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools` and `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools/call`
- a bundled stdio bridge at [`scripts/mcp_stdio_bridge.py`](./scripts/mcp_stdio_bridge.py)

The default MCP tool profile is `curated`, which keeps the browser surface compact for better tool selection. If you want the full internal tool surface, set:

```bash
MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=full
```

Raw tool-call example:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools/call \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name":"browser.create_session",
    "arguments":{
      "name":"demo",
      "start_url":"https://example.com"
    }
  }' | jq
```

Client setup guides:

- [`docs/mcp-clients.md`](./docs/mcp-clients.md)
- [`examples/claude-desktop-setup.md`](./examples/claude-desktop-setup.md)
- [`examples/cursor-mcp-setup.md`](./examples/cursor-mcp-setup.md)
- [`examples/claude_desktop_config.json`](./examples/claude_desktop_config.json)

## Security and Compliance

For a real private deployment, set at least:

```bash
APP_ENV=production
API_BEARER_TOKEN=<strong-random-secret>
REQUIRE_OPERATOR_ID=true
AUTH_STATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<44-char-fernet-key>
REQUIRE_AUTH_STATE_ENCRYPTION=true
REQUEST_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
METRICS_ENABLED=true
```

`COMPLIANCE_TEMPLATE` can apply a preconfigured posture at startup:

| Template  | Auth Encryption | Operator ID | PII Scrub      | Isolation          | Max Session Age |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| `HIPAA`   | required        | required    | all layers     | `docker_ephemeral` | 4h              |
| `PCI-DSS` | required        | required    | all layers     | `docker_ephemeral` | 1h              |
| `SOC2`    | -               | required    | network + text | shared             | 24h             |
| `GDPR`    | -               | -           | all layers     | shared             | 24h             |

All templates require upload approvals. `HIPAA`, `SOC2`, and `PCI-DSS` also enable Witness receipts. Startup writes the applied policy to `/data/compliance-manifest.json`.

Example:

```bash
COMPLIANCE_TEMPLATE=HIPAA docker compose up
```
